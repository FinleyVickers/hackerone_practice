# WHOOP Bug Bounty Testing Suite

This suite contains tools and documentation for testing the WHOOP bug bounty program while staying within the program scope.

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Tools

### 1. Reconnaissance (`tools/recon.py`)
- Domain enumeration
- Endpoint discovery
- Security header analysis
- Technology stack identification

Usage:
```bash
python tools/recon.py -o recon_results.json
```

### 2. API Security Tester (`tools/api_tester.py`)
Tests API endpoints for common vulnerabilities:
- CORS misconfigurations
- Authentication bypass attempts
- HTTP method enumeration

Usage:
```bash
python tools/api_tester.py -u https://api.whoop.com -e endpoints.txt -o api_results.json
```

## Testing Methodology

1. **Initial Reconnaissance**
   - Map out domains and subdomains
   - Identify API endpoints
   - Document technology stack

2. **Security Assessment**
   - Test authentication mechanisms
   - Check authorization controls
   - Analyze API security
   - Review data handling

3. **Vulnerability Validation**
   - Verify findings have real impact
   - Document clear proof of concepts
   - Ensure findings are in scope

## Important Notes

- Stay within program scope
- Do not test support systems
- Focus on findings with clear impact
- Provide detailed reproduction steps
- Respect rate limits and system stability
