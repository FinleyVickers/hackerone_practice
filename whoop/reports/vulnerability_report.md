# Security Vulnerability Report for WHOOP

## Summary
During security testing of WHOOP's web application and API infrastructure, several security issues were identified that could potentially impact the security and privacy of WHOOP's systems and user data.

## Findings

### 1. Missing Security Headers (Low Severity)
**Description:**  
Several pages on the WHOOP website are missing important security headers that help protect against common web vulnerabilities.

**Affected URLs:**
- https://www.whoop.com/ca/en/family-membership/
- https://www.whoop.com/thelocker/

**Missing Headers:**
- X-Frame-Options
- X-XSS-Protection
- Referrer-Policy

**Impact:**  
The absence of these security headers could potentially expose the application to:
- Clickjacking attacks (missing X-Frame-Options)
- Cross-site scripting attacks (missing X-XSS-Protection)
- Information leakage through referrers (missing Referrer-Policy)

**Reproduction Steps:**
1. Visit the affected URLs
2. Inspect the response headers
3. Note the absence of the mentioned security headers

**Recommendation:**  
Implement the following security headers across all web pages:
```http
X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN
X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
```

### 2. Debug Information Exposure (Medium Severity)
**Description:**  
Multiple JavaScript files contain debug information and error messages that could provide attackers with insights into the application's internal workings.

**Affected Files:**
- /_next/static/chunks/bce60fc1-13549079f3adf78e.js
- /_next/static/chunks/488-b13262f05116134b.js
- /_next/static/chunks/polyfills-78c92fac7aa8fdd8.js

**Impact:**  
The exposed debug information could:
- Reveal internal application logic
- Expose error handling mechanisms
- Provide attackers with information useful for crafting targeted attacks

**Reproduction Steps:**
1. Access the JavaScript files directly
2. Search for debug/error messages in the source code
3. Note the presence of detailed error messages and debug information

**Recommendation:**
1. Implement proper production builds that strip debug information
2. Use source maps in development only
3. Configure error handling to avoid exposing internal details in production

### 3. Version Information Disclosure (Medium Severity)
**Description:**  
Multiple JavaScript files expose detailed version information about the technologies and frameworks being used.

**Affected Components:**
- Next.js version: 18.3.0-canary-1cea38448-20230530
- React version: 13.4.5
- Other framework versions

**Impact:**  
Exposed version information allows attackers to:
- Research known vulnerabilities for specific versions
- Target attacks based on known framework weaknesses
- Plan more sophisticated attacks using version-specific exploits

**Reproduction Steps:**
1. Access the JavaScript files
2. Search for version strings
3. Note explicit version information in the source code

**Recommendation:**
1. Remove explicit version information from production builds
2. Implement version obfuscation in production code
3. Regularly update frameworks to latest secure versions

## Mitigation Timeline
We recommend addressing these vulnerabilities in the following order:

1. Immediate (1-2 days):
   - Implement missing security headers

2. Short-term (1-2 weeks):
   - Remove debug information from production builds
   - Implement proper error handling

3. Medium-term (2-4 weeks):
   - Implement version information obfuscation
   - Review and update all framework versions

## Additional Notes
- All testing was performed within the scope of WHOOP's bug bounty program
- No sensitive user data was accessed or compromised during testing
- All findings are based on passive reconnaissance and non-intrusive testing
