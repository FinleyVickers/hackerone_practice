# NBA Bug Bounty Program - Summary

## Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive reconnaissance of the NBA's digital infrastructure for the purpose of bug bounty research. We've identified several high-value targets and potential vulnerabilities that could be worth investigating as part of a bug bounty submission to the NBA's HackerOne program.

## Key Findings

1. **Developer Portal CORS Misconfiguration**
   - The developer portal (developerportal.nba.com) has CORS headers that allow credentials from localhost (127.0.0.1:3000)
   - This could potentially be exploited in a CORS attack if a developer can be tricked into visiting a malicious site while logged in

2. **Insufficient Security Headers**
   - The main NBA website lacks important security headers like Content-Security-Policy
   - HSTS is implemented but with a short max-age of only 1 day (86400 seconds)
   - Missing X-Frame-Options header could make the site vulnerable to clickjacking

3. **API Authentication**
   - The API endpoints (api.nba.com) return 401 Unauthorized and redirect to the developer portal
   - This suggests a potential target for authentication bypass or parameter manipulation

4. **Restricted Access Resources**
   - Several endpoints like data.nba.com return 403 Forbidden
   - These are potential targets for access control bypass testing

5. **Custom Infrastructure**
   - The presence of custom headers (X-Powered-By: NBA HTTPS) suggests custom infrastructure
   - Custom implementations often contain unique vulnerabilities not found in standard software

## High-Value Targets

1. **Developer Portal**: https://developerportal.nba.com/
   - Authentication system
   - CORS configuration
   - OAuth implementation (if present)

2. **API Endpoints**: https://api.nba.com/
   - Authentication mechanisms
   - Parameter handling
   - Rate limiting

3. **Data Subdomain**: https://data.nba.com/
   - Access controls
   - Directory traversal
   - Information disclosure

4. **Status Subdomain**: https://status.nba.com/
   - Custom headers
   - Information disclosure
   - Reflected XSS

## Tools Created

1. **CORS Test** (tools/cors_test.html)
   - Tests for CORS vulnerabilities in the NBA Developer Portal
   - Simulates requests from localhost:3000 with credentials

2. **API Endpoint Scanner** (tools/api_endpoint_scanner.py)
   - Discovers API endpoints by testing common paths
   - Identifies potential entry points for further testing

3. **Security Headers Checker** (tools/security_headers_check.py)
   - Checks for security headers on NBA domains
   - Identifies missing or misconfigured headers
   - Provides recommendations for improvement

## Potential High-Impact Vulnerabilities

1. **Authentication Bypass**
   - Finding a way to bypass authentication on the developer portal or API endpoints
   - This would be a critical vulnerability with high impact

2. **CORS Exploitation**
   - Exploiting the CORS configuration to steal sensitive information
   - This could lead to account takeover or data theft

3. **API Key Exposure**
   - Discovering exposed API keys in client-side code or public repositories
   - This could allow unauthorized access to NBA's APIs

4. **Access Control Bypass**
   - Finding ways to access restricted resources like data.nba.com
   - This could expose sensitive internal data

5. **Information Disclosure**
   - Identifying endpoints that leak sensitive information about the NBA's infrastructure
   - This could be used as a stepping stone for more serious attacks

## Next Steps

1. **Join the HackerOne Program**
   - Apply to the NBA's bug bounty program on HackerOne
   - Get the official scope and rules to ensure compliant testing

2. **Focused Testing**
   - Use the tools and findings in this repository to conduct focused testing
   - Prioritize the high-value targets and potential vulnerabilities identified

3. **Responsible Disclosure**
   - Follow responsible disclosure practices
   - Report any vulnerabilities through the proper channels

4. **Documentation**
   - Document all findings thoroughly
   - Provide clear steps to reproduce and potential impact

## Conclusion

The NBA's digital ecosystem presents several promising targets for bug bounty research. By systematically testing these targets for the vulnerabilities outlined in this repository, there's a good chance of discovering security issues that would qualify for the bug bounty program.

Remember to always conduct testing ethically and within the bounds of the program's rules and scope.
