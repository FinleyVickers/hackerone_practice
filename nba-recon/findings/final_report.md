# NBA Bug Bounty Program - Reconnaissance Report

## Executive Summary

This report summarizes our reconnaissance findings for the NBA Public Bug Bounty program on HackerOne. Due to limited public information about the program's scope and rewards, we've conducted passive reconnaissance to identify potential targets and vulnerabilities.

The NBA's digital ecosystem consists of multiple websites, APIs, and mobile applications. Our analysis has identified several high-value targets with potential security vulnerabilities that would be worth investigating as part of a bug bounty submission.

## Key Findings

1. **Developer Portal CORS Misconfiguration**: The developer portal (developerportal.nba.com) has CORS headers that allow credentials from localhost (127.0.0.1:3000), which could potentially be exploited.

2. **Insufficient Security Headers**: The main NBA website lacks important security headers like Content-Security-Policy and has a short HSTS max-age of only 1 day.

3. **API Authentication**: The API endpoints (api.nba.com) return 401 Unauthorized and redirect to the developer portal, suggesting a potential target for authentication bypass.

4. **Restricted Access Resources**: Several endpoints like data.nba.com return 403 Forbidden, indicating potential targets for access control bypass testing.

5. **Custom Infrastructure**: The presence of custom headers (X-Powered-By: NBA HTTPS) suggests custom infrastructure that may contain unique vulnerabilities.

## Recommended Testing Approach

### 1. Authentication & Authorization Testing

- Test for OAuth implementation flaws in the developer portal
- Look for authentication bypass in API endpoints
- Check for improper session management
- Test for IDOR vulnerabilities in authenticated endpoints

### 2. API Security Testing

- Analyze JavaScript files for exposed API endpoints and keys
- Test for parameter manipulation vulnerabilities
- Check for rate limiting issues
- Test for injection vulnerabilities in API parameters

### 3. Information Disclosure Testing

- Look for sensitive information in HTTP headers
- Check for directory listing vulnerabilities
- Analyze source code for developer comments containing sensitive information
- Test error handling for information leakage

### 4. Web Application Testing

- Test for XSS vulnerabilities in user input fields
- Check for CSRF vulnerabilities in authenticated actions
- Test for SSRF vulnerabilities in API endpoints
- Look for SQL injection points

### 5. Mobile Application Testing

- Decompile the NBA mobile apps to look for hardcoded credentials
- Test the security of API endpoints used by mobile apps
- Check for insecure data storage on the device
- Test certificate validation

## Potential High-Impact Vulnerabilities

1. **Authentication Bypass**: Finding a way to bypass authentication on the developer portal or API endpoints would be a critical vulnerability.

2. **CORS Exploitation**: The CORS configuration allowing credentials from localhost could potentially be exploited to steal sensitive information.

3. **API Key Exposure**: Discovering exposed API keys in client-side code or public repositories would be a significant finding.

4. **Access Control Bypass**: Finding ways to access restricted resources like data.nba.com would be valuable.

5. **Information Disclosure**: Identifying endpoints that leak sensitive information about the NBA's infrastructure or user data.

## Conclusion

The NBA's digital ecosystem presents several promising targets for bug bounty research. The developer portal, API endpoints, and restricted access resources are particularly interesting areas to focus on. By systematically testing these targets for the vulnerabilities outlined in this report, there's a good chance of discovering security issues that would qualify for the bug bounty program.

Before beginning active testing, it's recommended to join the HackerOne program to get the official scope and rules to ensure all testing is compliant with the program's guidelines.
