# NBA Bug Bounty Assessment

## Program Information
- **Program Name**: NBA Public Bug Bounty
- **Platform**: HackerOne
- **URL**: https://hackerone.com/nba-public?type=team

## Limited Information Available
Due to restricted access to the HackerOne program details, we've had to gather information from public sources and technical reconnaissance. The NBA Developer Portal indicates that API access is restricted to NBA Teams and Official NBA Business Partners.

## Discovered Assets

### Websites and Domains
1. **NBA.com**: Main website
   - Uses Envoy as a web server
   - Limited security headers (short HSTS max-age of 1 day)
   - Missing important security headers like Content-Security-Policy
   
2. **Developer Portal**: https://developerportal.nba.com/
   - Authentication required
   - Contains Cross-Origin headers that permit credentials from localhost (127.0.0.1:3000)
   - Potential target for API key leakage or improper access controls
   
3. **API Endpoints**: https://api.nba.com/ 
   - Returns 401 Unauthorized
   - Redirects to developerportal.nba.com
   - Potential target for authentication bypass

4. **Interesting Subdomains**:
   - data.nba.com (403 Forbidden)
   - status.nba.com (200 OK, custom header X-Powered-By: NBA HTTPS)

### Content Delivery Network
- Many NBA subdomains use AkamaiGHost for content delivery
- Potential for CDN-specific vulnerabilities

## Potential Vulnerability Areas

1. **Authentication & Authorization**
   - API key exposure in client-side code
   - Improper session management
   - OAuth implementation flaws
   - Authentication bypass in the developer portal

2. **API Security**
   - Insecure endpoints
   - Rate limiting issues
   - IDOR vulnerabilities
   - Insufficient input validation

3. **Information Disclosure**
   - Sensitive data exposure in responses
   - Directory listing
   - Developer comments in source code
   - API keys or secrets in JavaScript

4. **Web Application Vulnerabilities**
   - XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)
   - CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery)
   - SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery)
   - SQLi (SQL Injection)

5. **Access Control Issues**
   - Path traversal vulnerability on forbidden resources
   - Misconfigured permissions

## Testing Methodology

1. **Reconnaissance**
   - Subdomain enumeration
   - Technology stack identification
   - Content discovery
   - Endpoint mapping

2. **API Testing**
   - Authentication mechanisms
   - Authorization controls
   - Input validation
   - Rate limiting

3. **Web Application Testing**
   - Client-side security
   - Server-side security
   - Authentication and session management
   - Access controls

4. **Mobile Application Testing**
   - API endpoints used by mobile apps
   - Authentication implementation
   - Client-side storage of sensitive data

## Next Steps for Research

1. Continue subdomain enumeration
2. Test for common web vulnerabilities on accessible endpoints
3. Analyze JavaScript files for sensitive information disclosure
4. Look for publicly accessible API documentation
5. Search for leaked API keys or NBA developer documentation

## Limitations

Without proper access to the bug bounty program details, our assessment is limited to publicly accessible information. It's recommended to formally apply for the bug bounty program through HackerOne to get the full scope, eligibility criteria, and reward information.
