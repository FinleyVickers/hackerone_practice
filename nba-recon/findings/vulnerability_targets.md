# NBA Ecosystem Vulnerability Targets

Based on our reconnaissance of the NBA's digital infrastructure, we've identified the following high-value targets and potential vulnerabilities:

## 1. Developer Portal Authentication (https://developerportal.nba.com/)

### Key Findings:
- Access-Control-Allow-Origin header set to http://127.0.0.1:3000
- Access-Control-Allow-Credentials set to true
- Requires authentication but redirects from api.nba.com

### Potential Vulnerabilities:
- **CORS Misconfiguration**: The developer portal allows credentials from a localhost origin, which could be exploited if a developer can be tricked into visiting a malicious site while logged in.
- **OAuth Implementation Flaws**: If the portal uses OAuth, there may be vulnerabilities in the implementation such as improper state validation or redirect_uri validation.
- **Session Management Issues**: Poor session management could allow session hijacking or session fixation attacks.

## 2. API Endpoints (https://api.nba.com/)

### Key Findings:
- Returns 401 Unauthorized
- Redirects to developerportal.nba.com
- Uses AkamaiGHost as a server

### Potential Vulnerabilities:
- **API Key Exposure**: Look for API keys or credentials exposed in client-side code, GitHub repositories, or other public sources.
- **Parameter Manipulation**: Test for vulnerabilities in API endpoint parameters such as IDOR, injection, or logic flaws.
- **Rate Limiting Bypass**: Check if rate limiting can be bypassed using different IPs, headers, or authentication methods.
- **Authentication Bypass**: Test for ways to bypass authentication requirements.

## 3. data.nba.com (403 Forbidden)

### Key Findings:
- Returns a 403 Forbidden status
- Suggests the existence of potentially sensitive data

### Potential Vulnerabilities:
- **Directory Traversal**: Test for directory traversal vulnerabilities to access restricted content.
- **Access Control Bypass**: Look for ways to bypass access restrictions through parameter manipulation, header modification, or alternative paths.
- **Information Leakage**: Even 403 responses might leak information in headers or error messages.

## 4. status.nba.com (Custom Headers)

### Key Findings:
- Returns 200 OK
- Custom header: X-Powered-By: NBA HTTPS
- Likely a status or monitoring page

### Potential Vulnerabilities:
- **Information Disclosure**: The page might reveal internal system information, server versions, or infrastructure details.
- **Improper Access Controls**: Status pages often have weaker access controls than other parts of the application.
- **Reflected XSS**: Status pages that display request parameters are common targets for XSS.

## 5. NBA Main Website (www.nba.com)

### Key Findings:
- Uses Envoy as web server
- Limited security headers
- Short HSTS max-age of 86400 (1 day)

### Potential Vulnerabilities:
- **Missing Security Headers**: Absence of CSP, X-Frame-Options, and X-XSS-Protection headers increases vulnerability to various attacks.
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: Test input fields, URL parameters, and other user-controllable data points for XSS vulnerabilities.
- **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**: Check if sensitive actions are protected against CSRF attacks.
- **Content Injection**: Test for HTML, JavaScript, or CSS injection points.

## 6. Content Delivery Network (Akamai)

### Key Findings:
- Multiple NBA subdomains use AkamaiGHost

### Potential Vulnerabilities:
- **Cache Poisoning**: Test for HTTP header injection that might lead to cache poisoning.
- **Origin Validation Weaknesses**: Check if the CDN properly validates the origin of requests.
- **CDN Bypass**: Look for ways to bypass the CDN and reach origin servers directly.

## 7. NBA Mobile Applications

### Key Findings:
- Limited information gathered about mobile apps

### Potential Vulnerabilities:
- **Hardcoded Credentials**: Decompile the app to look for hardcoded API keys, tokens, or credentials.
- **Insecure Data Storage**: Check how sensitive data is stored on the device.
- **Man-in-the-Middle Vulnerability**: Test if the app properly validates SSL certificates.
- **API Endpoint Security**: Identify and test API endpoints used by the mobile app.

## Testing Priorities

1. **Developer Portal CORS and Authentication**: The CORS configuration allowing localhost with credentials is a priority target for investigation.

2. **API Endpoint Security**: Focus on discovering and testing API endpoints, particularly looking for authentication bypasses and IDOR vulnerabilities.

3. **Information Disclosure**: Look for sensitive information in JavaScript files, error messages, and HTTP headers across all NBA domains.

4. **Access Control Mechanisms**: Test access controls across the infrastructure, especially for data.nba.com and other restricted resources.

5. **Client-Side Security**: Investigate for XSS, CSRF, and other client-side vulnerabilities on the main NBA website and subdomains.

## Recommended Tools

- **Burp Suite**: For intercepting and modifying requests
- **OWASP ZAP**: For automated scanning
- **Sublist3r/Amass**: For additional subdomain enumeration
- **JWT_Tool**: If JWT tokens are used for authentication
- **MobSF**: For mobile application security testing
