# NBA Subdomain Analysis

## Initial Findings

| Subdomain | Status | Server | Notes |
|-----------|--------|--------|-------|
| www.nba.com | 200 OK | envoy | Main website |
| stats.nba.com | 301 Moved Permanently | AkamaiGHost | Redirects elsewhere |
| data.nba.com | 403 Forbidden | Not disclosed | Access denied - potential target |
| api.nba.com | 401 Unauthorized | AkamaiGHost | Requires authentication - high-value target |
| developer.nba.com | Not responding | N/A | Timeout or doesn't exist |
| admin.nba.com | 301 Moved Permanently | AkamaiGHost | Redirects - potential admin interface |
| secure.nba.com | Not responding | N/A | Timeout or doesn't exist |
| status.nba.com | 200 OK | X-Powered-By: NBA HTTPS | Status page - custom header reveals "NBA HTTPS" |
| global.nba.com | Not responding | N/A | Timeout or doesn't exist |
| int.nba.com | Not responding | N/A | Timeout or doesn't exist |

## Potential Vulnerability Areas

1. **API Endpoints (api.nba.com)**
   - Returned 401 Unauthorized
   - Potential for API security vulnerabilities:
     - Authentication bypass
     - Insufficient authorization checks
     - Information disclosure
     - Rate limiting issues

2. **Forbidden Area (data.nba.com)**
   - Returned 403 Forbidden
   - Could contain sensitive information
   - Potential for access control bypasses

3. **Status Server (status.nba.com)**
   - Custom header "X-Powered-By: NBA HTTPS"
   - Could be a custom application with unique vulnerabilities
   - May disclose system information

4. **Content Delivery Infrastructure**
   - Multiple endpoints using AkamaiGHost
   - Potential for CDN-specific vulnerabilities

## Next Steps

1. **API Testing:**
   - Attempt to identify API documentation
   - Test authentication/authorization mechanisms
   - Look for parameter manipulation vulnerabilities

2. **Access Control Testing:**
   - Test for path traversal on forbidden resources
   - Check for misconfigured access controls

3. **Information Disclosure:**
   - Examine response headers for sensitive information
   - Look for debugging information or developer comments

4. **Authentication Systems:**
   - Look for authentication endpoints
   - Test for common authentication vulnerabilities
